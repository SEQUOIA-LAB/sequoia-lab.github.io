Our research focuses on the intersection of computer security and quantum computing. We are exploring a variety of topics, including:

- **Quantum Cryptography:** Designing and analyzing cryptographic protocols that are secure against attacks from both classical and quantum computers.
- **Secure Systems:** Building and verifying secure software and hardware systems that can resist sophisticated cyberattacks.
- **Privacy-Enhancing Technologies:** Developing techniques to protect sensitive data while enabling valuable services.
