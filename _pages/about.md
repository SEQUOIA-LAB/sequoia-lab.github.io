Welcome to the Sequoia Lab, a research group at the University of California, Merced, led by Professor Qian Wang. Our mission is to explore the frontiers of computer security and quantum computing, developing innovative solutions to protect information and build the next generation of computing technologies.

At Sequoia, we are passionate about tackling challenging problems and making a real-world impact. Our research interests span a wide range of topics, including:

- **Quantum Cryptography:** Designing and analyzing cryptographic protocols that are secure against attacks from both classical and quantum computers.
- **Secure Systems:** Building and verifying secure software and hardware systems that can resist sophisticated cyberattacks.
- **Privacy-Enhancing Technologies:** Developing techniques to protect sensitive data while enabling valuable services.

We are always looking for talented and motivated students to join our team. If you are interested in pursuing research in security or quantum computing, please check out our [publications](/publications/) and get in touch with Professor Wang.

Thank you for visiting our website. We look forward to sharing our latest research and discoveries with you.
